# Citizen-Y

“Citizen Y” is a social TV + crowdvoting app that refers to “Citizen Kane” and “Generation Y”: Like the famous movie, “Citizen Y” aims to present different points of view on a same subject, and ask citizen communities to provide their feedback about divergent opinions in order to identify possible convergent policies and most desired actions. One “Citizen Y” cycle has 4 main steps limited in time:
1> propose a topic and post a challenge to build a community around the topic,
2> the community members select and publish video extracts (e.g. from information channels, or “opinion pitch” from political groups) presenting various opinions or existing policies related to the topic,
3> each member evaluate the individual content using a scale from "not at all" to "absolutely" to grade two assertions:
"I would like to have this policy implemented in my country/region."
"The implementation of this policy would require me a big effort or change in my daily life."
4> From the evaluation, the video contents can be classified to illustrate the opinion trends of the community about the related topic
